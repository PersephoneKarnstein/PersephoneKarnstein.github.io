[{"content":"The Xutsnoowú Ḵwáan,1 a tribe of the Tlingit people located on Admiralty Island, Southeast Alaska, is unfortunately best know to white America for one thing: they are the origin of the word \u0026amp;ldquo;hooch.\u0026amp;rdquo;\nWhen researching claims of pre-contact fermentation practices in the Pacific Northwest, I came across the following quote:\n\u0026amp;ldquo;Public efforts at prohibiting liquor to the Indian population of the coast were further complicated by the purchase of Alaska by the United States in 1867. The American troops sent to occupy the area, as well as others attracted to it, proved to be poorly disciplined and given to drunkenness, wild depredations, and gross immorality. Smuggling of liquor to the new territory became a common practice, along with bootlegging to the Indian population. However, perhaps an even more significant event was the introduction to the Indians of a technique for home-brewing liquor, reputedly by an intemperate soldier who had deserted or had been discharged from the military post at Fort Wrangell. This brew, known as hoochinoo, was concocted from a variety of ingredients, such as molasses, flour, dried apples, rice, potatoes, salmonberries, blackberries, yeast powder, and sometimes hops. Sufficient water was added to the selected ingredients to make a thin batter. After fermentation took place, a sour, muddy, highly alcoholic liquor was produced. Distillation was accomplished through using coal-oil cans for retorts and kelp for condensation tubes. The Alaska Indians distilled hoochinoo for the white trade as well as for themselves, the technique soon diffused southward throughout the coastal area and inland and became the source of liquor for many bands.\u0026amp;rdquo;2\nThis initially tickeled me because I found the concept of a still made of an oilcan and a kelp trunk endearing, when I went to reseatch this tangent in more detail I fell into a whole rabbithole around what essentially amounts to a historical moonshine.\nThe Name Lemert footnotes his description of hoochinoo with the following comment:\n\u0026amp;ldquo;The term hoochinoo apparently was derived from the name of a Tlingit Indian tribe that lived in the southwestern part of Admiralty Island off the Alaskan coast, a tribe notorious for its truculence and manufacture of fiery home-brew. Sheldon Jackson, Alaska and the Missions of the North Pacific Coast, pp. 241-242. Another translation of the term is \u0026amp;ldquo;bear\u0026amp;rsquo;s nest,\u0026amp;rdquo; referring to the kind of place in which the drink was made. Jeanette Nichols, History of Alaska, p. 106.\u0026amp;rdquo;\nThis is incorrect in multiple respects. While \u0026amp;ldquo;Xutsnoowú\u0026amp;rdquo; does indeed mean \u0026amp;ldquo;fortress of brown bears,\u0026amp;rdquo; this fact is unrelated to \u0026amp;ldquo;the kind of place in which the drink was made.\u0026amp;rdquo; Several other sources similarly claim that the Ḵwáan was named after the drink, rather than vice versa. However, transliterations of the name can be found at least as far back as 1818, when Fedor Ivanovich Shemelin\u0026amp;rsquo;s \u0026amp;ldquo;Journal of the First Voyage of Russians around the Earthly Globe\u0026amp;rdquo;3 recorded that in ca. 1802, \u0026amp;ldquo;Судно Глобусь, Капитань Кюннень-Жеинъ зимовало подь Хуцновскимъ жиломъ\u0026amp;rdquo; (The ship Globus, Captain Künnen-Zhein, wintered near the Khutsnovsk settlement). In this sentence, \u0026amp;ldquo;Хуцновскимъ\u0026amp;rdquo; (Khutsnovskim) is the instrumental/locative adjectival form of \u0026amp;ldquo;Хуцнов\u0026amp;rdquo; (Khutsov), a transliteration of the Tlingit Xootsnoowú. The name was therefore demonstrably in use over half a century before the American introduction of distillation to the Tlingit.\nI also just don\u0026amp;rsquo;t like describing an entire Ḵwáan as \u0026amp;ldquo;notorious for its truculence\u0026amp;rdquo; \u0026amp;ndash; especially when the description is in the context of similar descriptions explicitly identifying that truculence with some immutable and undesirable trait of the people themselves (possibly due to over-imbibing) rather than the political stance of a community facing the violence of a colonialist takeover.\nThe Drink William Gouverneur Morris, in his 1879 Report Upon the Customs District, Public Service, and Resources of Alaska Territory, laments the effects of the drink, writing (TW for 1879-style extreme racism):\n\u0026amp;ldquo;The natives manufacture by distillation from molasses a vile, poisonous, life and soul destroying decoction, called \u0026amp;lsquo;Hoochenoo,\u0026amp;rsquo; which saps the very essence of the human system, producing crime, disease, insanity, and death. When drunk and crazed from the deleterious effects of this accursed drink, the natives, Aleuts, half-breed Russians, and mongrel population, are in a condition bordering upon phrensy, and at this time is to be dreaded the perpetration of outrage and outbreak which will surely be the result if this infamous traffic is continued.\u0026amp;rdquo;4\nA few pages later, he continues ranting, helpfully including a recipe, nominally for the purposes of proposing new contraband categories.\n\u0026amp;ldquo;Molasses rum, or hootzenoo, is made by the whites and Indians in Alaska …","date":"2026-01-15","permalink":"https://example.org/post/hooch/","section":"post","summary":"The Xutsnoowú Ḵwáan,1 a tribe of the Tlingit people located on Admiralty Island, Southeast Alaska, is unfortunately best know to white America for one thing: they are the origin of the word …","tags":["distillation","history","recipes"],"title":"Hooch"},{"content":"If you ever find yourself reading through the Wikipedia article on \u0026amp;ldquo;Alcohol and Native Americans\u0026amp;rdquo; or \u0026amp;ldquo;The History of Alcoholic Beverages,\u0026amp;rdquo; you may find the following passages:\n\u0026amp;ldquo;In the northwest, the Kwakiutl of Vancouver Island produced a mildly alcoholic drink using elderberry juice, black chitons, and tobacco.[57] Despite the fact that they had little to no agriculture, both the Aleuts and Yuit of Kodiak Island in Alaska were observed making alcoholic drinks from fermented raspberries.[56]\u0026amp;rdquo;1\nand,\n\u0026amp;ldquo;In addition: [\u0026amp;hellip;] The Kwakiutl of Vancouver Island produced a mildly alcoholic drink using elderberry juice, black chitons, and tobacco.[56] [\u0026amp;hellip;] Both the Aleuts and Yuit of Kodiak Island in Alaska were observed making alcoholic drinks from fermented raspberries.[55]2\nBoth of these reference the same two sources as evidence:\nCherrington, EH. \u0026amp;ldquo;Aborigines of North America.\u0026amp;rdquo; In E. H. Cherrington (Ed.), Standard Encyclopedia of the Alcohol Problem, Westerville, OH 1925; Vol I, pp. 3-42. (regarding raspberries) Lemert, EM. Alcohol and the Northwest Coast Indians. University of California Publications in Culture and Society, vol 2, No. 6. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1954. (regarding elderberry/chiton/tobacco) Both claims, and both citations, were added by Wikipedia user Cmacauley, around the middle of August 2019. They were originally sourced to Patrick J. Abbott, M.D.\u0026amp;rsquo;s 1996 paper, \u0026amp;ldquo;American Indian and Alaska Native Aboriginal Use Of Alcohol In The United States\u0026amp;rdquo;3, and later updated to reflect the sources from which Abbott pulled his claims.\nIf you\u0026amp;rsquo;re a nerd like me with a special interest in ethnobotanical fermentation practices, this is catnip: two traditions from the Pacific Northwest for me to recreate? Amazing. There\u0026amp;rsquo;s just one problem: Neither of the traditions are real. Let me explain.\nElderberry, Chiton, and Tobacco Let\u0026amp;rsquo;s first examine the claim that \u0026amp;ldquo;The Kwakiutl of Vancouver Island produced a mildly alcoholic drink using elderberry juice, black chitons, and tobacco.\u0026amp;rdquo; This claim is directly sourced to the work of Edwin M. Lemert (May 8, 1912 – November 10, 1996), a sociology professor at the University of California. The full passage is as follows:\n\u0026amp;ldquo;All available evidence seems to concur in placing the native peoples of the Northwest Coast of America among American Indians who in aboriginal times were without knowledge and techniques for brewing or distilling intoxicating beers or liquors. One exceptional note comes from reports on the Kwakiutl of Vancouver Island, who made a beverage of elderberry juice, black chitons, and tobacco, which they claimed \u0026amp;ldquo;made them dizzy.\u0026amp;rdquo; However, white men who tried this concoction did not experience any feelings of intoxication. Even allowing for the possibility that the drink was an intoxicant, it remains clear that at the time of initial contact of the Indians with white culture it was neither in widespread use in the coastal area nor indeed of any noticeable significance as a culture trait of the Kwakiutl.4 5\nThis drink sounds fascinating \u0026amp;ndash; perhaps somewhere between an elderberry fruit-wine and an oyster stout, with tobacco used simultaneously as a bittering agent and for its psychoactive effects. I tried making a very loose recreation from elderberry juice (Sambuccus nigra), flue-cured tobacco leaves (Nicotiana tabacum), and abalone (as Black Chitons are both not available commercially and protected in the USA from idle foragers under the Coastal Zone Management Act) \u0026amp;hellip; and nearly poisoned myself and my housemate with a lethal dose of nicotine upon tasting it.\nThis raises the first issue with the claim of a drink containing tobacco leaves. Nicotine is completely soluble in water below 60.8°C, meaning that a tea extracts a huge amount of nicotine from the leaves. While 53-77% of total nicotine is matrix-bound in cured tobacco (requiring temperatures above ~200°C for thermal release)6, and swallowed nicotine undergoes extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism which reduces systemic bioavailability to 20-40% of the total ingested7, that still means that 10 grams of N. tabacum could release as much as 230 mg nicotine into a tea, of which 92 mg would enter the drinker\u0026amp;rsquo;s bloodstream, a potentially lethal dose.\nAnother concern is the variability of nicotine content between species, or even between two plants of the same species. Three species of tobacco are native to Washington State: N. rustica, N. attenuata, and N. quadrivalvis. Of these, N. quadrivalvis is likely what the Kwakiutl would have the most access to, and indeed records exist of Kwakiutl families growing it in garden plots. N. quadrivalvis also has the lowest nicotine content of the three, and while thus theoretically the safest to brew, still contains enough nicotine for a tea made with 71 g of dried leaves to be likely fatal.\nIf it were merely a …","date":"2026-01-14","permalink":"https://example.org/post/elderberry-chiton/","section":"post","summary":"If you ever find yourself reading through the Wikipedia article on \u0026ldquo;Alcohol and Native Americans\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;The History of Alcoholic Beverages,\u0026rdquo; you may find the following passages: …","tags":["ethnobotany","fermentation","history","recipes"],"title":"Two Drinks That Never Were: Native Alcohol Traditions in the Pacific Northwest"},{"content":"Look, sometimes you need quite a large volume of artificial saliva for very normal reasons. We\u0026amp;rsquo;ve all been there. In my case, it\u0026amp;rsquo;s because I was researching pre-contact fermentation practices in the Americas, and wanted an alternative to manually chewing starchy base ingredients (corn in the case of chicha, or mesquite beans in the specific case I was researching \u0026amp;ndash; more on that later.) What if, I thought, instead of manually chewing the beans I could instead put them in something like a mochi machine with my artificial saliva, and pseudo-masticate them that way.\nIt turns out I was not the first person to want artificial saliva, of course. There\u0026amp;rsquo;s even a standard mixture: the Fusayama-Meyer Standard. You can buy it for $200/200 mL from Fischer Scientific, or $233 from Sigma Aldrich, and it\u0026amp;rsquo;s widely used for testing dental metal alloys, among other uses. That\u0026amp;rsquo;s a bit expensive, though, for what is mostly just me fucking around with some ethnobotany. Fusayama-Meyer does give us a good hint as to what we should include in our artificial saliva, however, specifically:\nComponent Concentration Common Name Source \\(NaCl\\) 400 mg/L Sodium Chloride, Table Salt Any store \\(KCl\\) 400 mg/L Potassium Chloride, Muriate of Potash Amazon \\(CaCl_2\\cdot H_2O\\) 795 mg/L Calcium chloride Modernist Pantry \\(Na_2H_2PO_4\\cdot H_2O\\) 690 mg/L Disodium Phosphate Amazon \\(KSCN\\) 300 mg/L Potassium Thiocyanate Amazon, Lab Alley \\(Na_2S\\cdot 9H_2O\\) 5 mg/L Sodium Sulfide Nonahydrate Amazon \\(CH_4N_2O\\) 1000 mg/L Urea Amazon In fact, there are quite a lot of recipes used in scientific literature for artificial saliva, based on what the intended purpose is1, and even more articles on the enzymatic, protein, and electrolyte composition of saliva2. These give us a good starting place for our recipe.\nSo putting this all together, we have the following recipe:\nIngredients:\n1 L distilled water 682.0 mg Potassium chloride (\\(KCl\\)) 630.8 mg Bicarbonate of soda (\\(NaHCO_3\\)) 600.0 mg Urea (\\(CH_4N_2O\\)) 460.0 mg Disodium Phosphate (\\(NaH_2PO_4\\cdot 2H_2O\\)) 435.0 mg Potassium dihydrogen phosphate (\\(KH_2PO_4\\)) (source 1, 2) 340.0 mg Calcium chloride (\\(CaCl_2\\cdot 2H_2O\\)) 336.5 mg Sodium Sulfate (\\(Na_2SO_4\\)) 262.8 mg Table salt (\\(NaCl\\)) 244.6 mg Potassium Thiocyanate (\\(KSCN\\)) 200 mg α-amylase (source 1) 178.0 mg Ammonium Chloride (\\(NH_4Cl\\)) (source 1) 5.0 mg Sodium Sulfide Nonahydrate (\\(Na_2S\\cdot 9H_2O\\)) (optional) All solid ingredients should be dissolved in the water, and the mixture should be used at approximately 30ºC. For storage, the dry ingredients should be kept as a dry mixture and only reconstituted as needed.\nWhile this formulation ends up costing a decent amount (about $200 from amazon), that $200 is enough to make 230 L of saliva, with Disodium Phosphate and Potassium dihydrogen phosphate (followed by Potassium chloride at 733 Liters\u0026amp;rsquo; worth) being the limiting reagents. This makes our formulation roughly 1,150 times more cost-efficient than the Sigma Aldrich supply discussed above.\nWhy saliva though?\nEthnobotany The real answer is that it comes from my misremenbering an indigenous fermentation practice I had read about. Willis Harvey Bell and Edward Franklin Castetter, in \u0026amp;ldquo;The utilization of mesquite and screwbean by the aborigines in the American Southwest,\u0026amp;rdquo; describe an indigenous tradition involving chewing mesquite beans by the people of the Colorado River delta in Baja, likely meaning the Xawiƚƚ kwñchawaay (Cocopah) nation.\n\u0026amp;ldquo;At the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century, Pattie (135 :94), Indian trader and trapper, noted that the Indians of New Mexico and Arizona pounded mesquite pods in a mortar and made the pulp into bread, while Hardy saw the plant about the same time in Baja California on both sides of the Colorado River, and observed that the Indians in the latter region allowed mesquite pods to ferment in water in an earthen bowl. They chewed these pods to remove the fermenting liquid, then spat them back into the bowl. He recorded that the Indians of Tiburon Island [the Comcáac (Seri) people] engaged in this same practice (61 :330-37, 434, 446).\u0026amp;rdquo;3\nI, or the wikipedia editor whose work I was reading, misremembered or misunderstood this to mean that the beans were chewed in a similar manner to the production of Chicha de muko or Kuchikamizake. This does not seem to have been the case, however,\nAfter extensive searching, the only reference I could find to fermented mesquite comes from La Barre (1938)4:\n\u0026amp;ldquo;Algoroba, a South American beer made from the fruits of leguminous plants, Prosopis alba, P. pallida and P. juliflora (mesquite beans)\n\u0026amp;hellip;\nKiwa, a Gran Chaco [the people of modern-day Bolivia] name for algoroba; Prosopis juliflora beans are chewed and fermented in goat-skins, as the natives chant and beat the drum to drive away evil spirits who would spoil the brew.
